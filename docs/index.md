## Software scope

openAMUNDSEN-DA is an open-source data assimilation framework built around
[openAMUNDSEN](https://doc.openamundsen.org/). It preprocesses configured snow
observations, prepares deterministic assimilation sequences, executes an
ensemble particle-filter workflow and validates the resulting tables, grids,
plots, maps and report.

The documentation is deliberately technical. The openAMUNDSEN-DA framework and
its Rofental application are described in the
[EGUsphere preprint by Wagner et al. (2026)](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2026-4575).
This repository documents the software interface and operational workflow.

![openAMUNDSEN-DA technical workflow from mounted setup inputs through observation summaries and prepared steps to validated results]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/diagrams/openamundsen-da-workflow.svg)

*The host setup is mounted at `/data`. openAMUNDSEN-DA summarizes configured snow
observations, prepares inspectable event inputs and writes a validated result set.*

## Start here

- [Installation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link installation.md %}) explains the Python
  package and wheel-based Docker image.
- [Input data]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guides/observations.md %}) defines required
  model, forcing and observation inputs without prescribing product-generation algorithms.
- [Configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guides/configuration.md %}) documents the
  strict setup, project and step ownership boundary.
- [Running the model]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link running.md %}) covers the supported single-domain
  and subdomain command sequences.
- [Output data]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link output-data.md %}) defines the manifest,
  compact NetCDF, diagnostics and cleanup contract.
- [Example data sets]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link example-data.md %}) describes the
  shipped Rofental example.
- [How to Use]({{ '/tutorial/' | relative_url }}) is the reviewed, continuous
  Rofental walkthrough.
